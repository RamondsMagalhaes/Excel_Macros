# Excel_Macros
Macros made in 2020 to 2021 to assist in day to day office work at a medium size company (13 employees at the time).
They couln't implement a database for work culture reasons and all of the stock and cash control was done in excel, naturaly requiring repetitive and manual to maintain

These VBA solutions are only useful to that particular company and can hardly be reused or reporposed. 
However I keep the source code here as a memento because it was my first pratical software solution with tangible impact, saving the company over 8 hours a week of typing and error hunting.
